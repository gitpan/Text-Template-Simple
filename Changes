	   (older perls don't have a Win32.pm)

0.46 Thu Dec 21 20:16:33 2006
	=> Bugfix in _resume().

	   Text::Template::Simple.

0.45 Sat Dec 16 22:15:18 2006
	=> Internal optimization.
	=> Added line number and file name emulation to parser.
	   You have to use file templates or enable cache to 
	   enable this feature.
