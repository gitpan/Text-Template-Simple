* Improve unit test coverage.
        o Increase # of tests
        o Implement placeholder tests
* Move all croak messages into fatal().
* Remove code templates from ::Constants (into ::Simple)
        o Tidy up ::Constants.
* Implement variable sharing without monolith..?
        o PROCESS -> no monolith ?
            - Interpolated includes does not respect monolith though :p
              This needs fix.
* Improve error handling. Minimize uncontrolled die()s.
* Improve safe compartment.
* Improve cache.
        o Improve the cache file format.
* Test -T support.
* Command line compiler?
* Re-implement or remove resume interface
        o Perhaps eval { sub { ... }; 1; } || "ERR: $@"
*  ***LOW*** Move trim/tilde/quote from tokenizer & into the parser.
*  ***LOW*** Consider trying PPI.
*  ***LOW*** Implement TTS plugins for major frameworks.
*  ***LOW*** Consider building a tiny framework for template plugins.
        o Or just let the user define subs in ::Dummy.
*  ***LOW*** Consider implementing TT like filters
        o Block filters
*  ***LOW*** Benchmarks?
*  ***LOW*** XS based tokenizer?
* Keep the code clean & simple (no hacks?).
* Check competitors for neat ideas (heh!).
