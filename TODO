[TARGET: 0.60]

* Implement & document:
        o $t->compile( [ FILE   => $thing ] );
        o $t->compile( [ GLOB   => $thing ] );
        o $t->compile( [ STRING => $thing ] );
* Remove code templates from ::Constants (into ::Simple)
        o Tidy up ::Constants.
* Implement variable sharing without monolith..?
        o PROCESS -> no monolith ?
* Move token string to the first row in tokens.
* Replace token ids with hex or int.
        o Remove long names
        o Remove "eq"
* ***LOW*** Move trim/tilde/quote from tokenizer & into the parser.
* Cleanup ::Simple
        o Update Pod
* Improve unit test coverage.
        o Implement placeholder tests (24-include-paths.t).
        o Increase # of tests

[BEYOND]

* Keep the code clean & simple (no hacks?).
* Improve error handling. Minimize uncontrolled die()s.
*  ***LOW*** Consider trying PPI.
* Improve safe compartment.
* Improve cache.
* Test -T support.
*  ***LOW*** Implement TTS plugins for major frameworks.
*  ***LOW*** Consider building a tiny framework for template plugins.
        o Or just let the user define subs in ::Dummy.
*  ***LOW*** Consider implementing TT like filters
        o Block filters
        o Include filters
                - Seems to be tricky with interpolation in effect.
*  ***LOW*** Benchmarks?
*  ***LOW*** XS based tokenizer?
* Command line compiler?
* Check competitors for neat ideas (heh!).
