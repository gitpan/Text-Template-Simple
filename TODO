* Interpolated includes can not be used with monolith. It does not seem to be
  possible to use shared variables in interpolated includes. An error message
  is returned instead at the moment. Options:
     o Remove monolith from the API
     o Leave it as-is. i.e.: an error message will be returned
     o Find a new way to implement interpolated includes (if possible at all!).
* Implement a way to find out the name of the top level file which included the
  sub-template.
* Fix line numbering. It's probably badly broken (chomp, code/comment blocks, etc.)
    o Implement a unit test related to this.
* A more flexible BLOCK implementation. Which:
    o Can have code in it
    o Can be used later (like a function)
* ***LOW*** Consider trying PPI. Resume?
* ***LOW*** Implement TTS plugins for major frameworks.
* ***LOW*** Benchmarks?
